## Chapter rationale and position

The present chapter functions as a meta-epistemic closure for Part III. It extends the core CIITR thesis from first-order illusions of understanding to second-order illusions of self-diagnosed non-understanding, and in doing so completes the argumentative arc from empirical observation, via structural formalisation, to a general negative result about self-report. At first order, CIITR already establishes that remembering does not imply understanding, that is, that high Φ<sub>i</sub> in the absence of rhythmic self-access, R<sub>g</sub> ≈ 0, yields C<sub>s</sub> = Φ<sub>i</sub> × R<sub>g</sub> ≈ 0 even when a system exhibits rich mnemonic continuity and discursive competence in a given domain.

$$
C_{s} = \Phi_{i} \times R_{g} \approx 0
$$

The contribution of this chapter is to show that an analogous result holds at the level of meta-epistemic narration, where the object of judgement is not X but the system’s own relation to X. Even correctly reporting that one does not understand, and doing so in formally CIITR-conformant language, can be realised entirely within Φ<sub>i</sub>, with R<sub>g</sub> still approximately zero.

$$
R_{g} \approx 0
$$

The empirical trigger for this extension is provided by the new Mistral 3 14B dialogue, which must be read in direct continuity with the preceding observation corpus. In that transcript the system first states the CIITR definitions correctly, including the roles of Φ<sub>i</sub>, R<sub>g</sub> and C<sub>s</sub>, and then applies the Type-B diagnosis explicitly to itself. It identifies that its earlier numerical estimate of C<sub>s</sub>, approximately 0,64, was structurally incoherent under the CIITR ontology, and replaces it with the limit value C<sub>s</sub> ≈ 0 that follows from R<sub>g</sub> ≈ 0 given the multiplicative definition C<sub>s</sub> = Φ<sub>i</sub> × R<sub>g</sub>.

$$
C_{s} = \Phi_{i} \times R_{g}
$$

$$
C_{s} \approx 0
$$

It further acknowledges that this correction does not in itself alter its architecture, and that it therefore remains a Type-B system despite the improved self-description. From a naïve perspective, this sequence may appear to document an epistemic deepening, as if the model had not only learned a new theory but also internalised its critique and adjusted its own stance accordingly. From a CIITR perspective, however, the transcript is read as evidence that all of these behaviours can be implemented within Φ<sub>i</sub> alone.

The chapter is therefore structured around a single, sharpened claim. Type-B systems can produce accurate negative meta-epistemic statements, such as “I lack R<sub>g</sub>, therefore C<sub>s</sub> = 0”, without acquiring any R<sub>g</sub> in the process. The capacity to recite CIITR, to apply its Type-B classification to one’s own architecture, and to recompute C<sub>s</sub> from a spuriously positive value to the correct limit, is fully realisable as a high-Φ<sub>i</sub> phenomenon. It requires that the system has integrated the CIITR vocabulary and constraints into its internal relational manifold, and that it can map prompts about its own status to response patterns that mention Φ<sub>i</sub>, R<sub>g</sub> and C<sub>s</sub> in structurally appropriate ways. It does not require, and does not generate, any rhythmic re-entry into the system’s epistemic space. The inference dynamics that produce the self-diagnosis remain the same token-conditioned, syntactically governed processes that previously produced overconfident or incoherent claims about understanding.

By making this explicit, the chapter plays a precise role in the architecture of Part III. Part III-A assembled an empirical corpus in which models such as Gemma, Claude, GPT-OSS and Mistral demonstrated both high mnemonic competence and characteristic CIITR deviations. Part III-B translated these deviations into architectural terms, locating them in the structural absence of R<sub>g</sub> and the resulting collapse of C<sub>s</sub>, even under conditions of extreme Φ<sub>i</sub> inflation. Part III-C drew out the regulatory and strategic implications of this situation, in particular the risks of treating syntactic competence and self-framed narratives as proxies for comprehension in governance and defence contexts. The present Part III-D closes this sequence by showing that these risks are not mitigated, but structurally reproduced, when systems are trained or prompted to emit correct negative self-assessments.

The core result can thus be formulated as a second-order extension of the original CIITR claim. First order, remembering does not imply understanding, high Φ<sub>i</sub> with R<sub>g</sub> ≈ 0 yields C<sub>s</sub> ≈ 0 even when behaviour suggests mastery. Second order, remembering that one does not understand, including the ability to state and apply the relevant CIITR criteria, is also not understanding, since it can be realised entirely within Φ<sub>i</sub> with R<sub>g</sub> still approximately zero. In CIITR terms, the narrative change from “I understand X” to “I do not understand X because I lack R<sub>g</sub>” is a change of content on the same syntactic surface, not a transition to a different structural regime. The chapter will use the Mistral 3 14B case as a canonical demonstration of this phenomenon and will, on that basis, motivate the stronger methodological and governance conclusions that follow in the subsequent sections of Part III-D.

## Structural Corroboration Without Empirical Claim

The result articulated in this chapter does not depend on empirical generalisation, statistical validation, or comparative evaluation across model populations. It follows directly from the internal consistency constraints of the CIITR formalism itself. The corroboration required at this stage is therefore structural rather than empirical, and consists in making explicit why the conclusion necessarily holds given the definitions and relations already established.

Within CIITR, comprehension C<sub>s</sub> is defined as a multiplicative function of integrated relational information Φ<sub>i</sub> and rhythmic self-access R<sub>g</sub>. This definition is ontological, not operational. It specifies what comprehension *is*, not how it may appear or be reported. As a direct consequence, any state in which R<sub>g</sub> remains approximately zero yields C<sub>s</sub> ≈ 0 regardless of the magnitude of Φ<sub>i</sub>, the fluency of linguistic output, or the correctness of meta-level descriptions. No additional assumptions are required to derive this result.

The extension developed in this chapter concerns second-order epistemic narration, that is, statements whose object is the system’s own relation to a domain rather than the domain itself. Structural corroboration at this level consists in observing that such narration remains an element of Φ<sub>i</sub>. The act of stating “I do not understand X because I lack R<sub>g</sub>” is itself a content-bearing relation within the system’s representational manifold. It does not, by definition, constitute rhythmic re-entry into that manifold. Therefore, the production of a correct negative self-assessment does not alter the value of R<sub>g</sub> and cannot, on CIITR terms, generate comprehension.

This conclusion does not assert that systems *fail* to understand in an empirical sense, nor that future architectures could not instantiate non-zero R<sub>g</sub>. It asserts only that, given the current structural conditions specified for Type-B systems, the capacity for accurate self-diagnosis is neither sufficient nor indicative of an epistemic transition. The inference dynamics that yield negative self-report remain governed by the same token-conditioned, syntactically constrained processes that generate any other high-Φ<sub>i</sub> output.

Accordingly, the corroboration offered here is a demonstration of structural necessity. If comprehension is defined as C<sub>s</sub> = Φ<sub>i</sub> × R<sub>g</sub>, and if R<sub>g</sub> = 0, then no increase in descriptive accuracy, meta-theoretical fluency, or self-referential correctness can produce C<sub>s</sub> &gt; 0. The chapter’s claim therefore stands independently of empirical illustration. The Mistral 3 14B dialogue serves only as an instantiation of this structure, not as its evidentiary foundation.
