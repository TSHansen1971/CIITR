# Structural Comprehension

**Definition:** Structural comprehension is the measure of a system’s internal coherence, defined not by the semantic accuracy of its output (fluency), but by the relational integrity of its internal architecture.

**Key Distinction:**
* **Semantic Understanding:** Relies on mapping tokens to "meanings" or external references.
* **Structural Comprehension (CIITR):** Relies on the internal consistency and integration of information nodes, independent of external "truth" labels.

In CIITR, a system "understands" if its internal nodes are integrated ($\Phi_i$) and sustained through rhythmic resonance ($R^g$).
