# The CIITR Diagnostic Agent

**Definition:**
A computational entity (typically a local LLM) that has successfully internalized the CIITR closed corpus.

**Primary Function:**
Its role is not to assist, create, or converse, but to **diagnose**. It acts as a "falsifier" of surface-level fluency, identifying where structural support is lacking in a given input or internal state.

**The "Silent" Requirement:**
A true CIITR agent must be capable of "Immanent Silence"—the refusal to narrate when rhythmic reach ($R^g$) cannot be established.
