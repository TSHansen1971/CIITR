| Date       | Filename | Theory note / paper / article synopsis | Description / argument why CIITR relevant |
|------------|----------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 2025-11-08 | [Meta’s SPICE and the Illusion of Self-Improvement.pdf](2025.11.08%20-%20Meta%E2%80%99s%20SPICE%20and%20the%20Illusion%20of%20Self-Improvement.pdf) | Structural-thermodynamic CIITR analysis of adversarial self-play | Analyzes Meta’s SPICE self-play architecture through CIITR, showing Φᵢ growth with Rᵍ ≈ 0 yields performance without retained comprehension. Identifies an embryonic (proto) Rᵍ via shared-weight oscillation, explains CPJ decay under external verification, and outlines architectural pathways to convert proto-rhythm into genuine rhythmic reintegration, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-07 | [Beyond Scale - A CIITR Analysis of Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI and the 57 Billion Paradigm Error.pdf](2025.11.07%20-%20Beyond%20Scale%20-%20A%20CIITR%20Analysis%20of%20Small%20Language%20Models%20are%20the%20Future%20of%20Agentic%20AI%20and%20the%2057%20Billion%20Paradigm%20Error.pdf) | Industrial-scale CIITR analysis of SLM vs LLM paradigms | Reinterprets NVIDIA Research’s SLM findings through CIITR, arguing that the “$57 billion” scaling paradigm error reflects Φᵢ growth outpacing rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ), leading to collapsing comprehension yield. Positions CIITR as a structural and thermodynamic explanatory framework for why smaller, rhythmically coupled agentic systems outperform monolithic scale prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-06 | [Beyond the Reasoning Cliff.pdf](2025.11.06%20-%20Beyond%20the%20Reasoning%20Cliff.pdf) | CIITR reinterpretation of empirical reasoning depth collapse in LRMs | Reanalyzes the empirically observed “reasoning cliff” in large reasoning models as a collapse of rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) rather than computational saturation. Uses CIITR to explain why increasing reasoning depth (Φᵢ) without temporal re-entry yields abrupt loss of comprehension, positioning CIITR as a unifying framework for understanding limits of verifiable reasoning prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-06 | [Beyond Verifiable Reasoning - A CIITR Analysis of the SciencePedia Framework.pdf](2025.11.06%20-%20Beyond%20Verifiable%20Reasoning%20-%20A%20CIITR%20Analysis%20of%20the%20SciencePedia%20Framework.pdf) | Comparative CIITR analysis of verifiable long chains-of-thought systems | Analyzes the SciencePedia LCoT framework through CIITR, showing that large gains in verifiable reasoning fidelity (Φᵢ) without rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) produce syntactic completeness without comprehension continuity. Positions CIITR as a meta-evaluative framework distinguishing externalized verification from internally sustained understanding, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-06 | [Inverse Comprehension and the Limits of Evolutionary AI - A CIITR Analysis of AlphaEvolve.pdf](2025.11.06%20-%20Inverse%20Comprehension%20and%20the%20Limits%20of%20Evolutionary%20AI%20-%20A%20CIITR%20Analysis%20of%20AlphaEvolve.pdf) | Analytical CIITR critique of evolutionary AI and synthetic discovery claims | Applies CIITR to DeepMind’s AlphaEvolve system, showing that high evolutionary Φᵢ combined with near-zero Rᵍ yields null structural comprehension despite formal progress. Introduces inverse comprehension and scaling-illusion dynamics, demonstrating CIITR’s capacity to distinguish computational evolution from cognitive understanding prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-04 | [The Φi / Rg Dissolution Metric.pdf](2025.11.04%20-%20The%20%CE%A6i%20-%20Rg%20Dissolution%20Metric.pdf) | Metric-oriented analysis of structural comprehension collapse under load | Introduces the Φᵢ/Rᵍ dissolution metric and the concept of C–R thermodynamic evasion, analyzing systematic comprehension collapse in large reasoning models under increasing compositional complexity. Serves as an early diagnostic and stress-testing exploration of rhythmic persistence within CIITR, preceding kernel-level instrumentation rules and formal admissibility constraints. |
| 2025-11-04 | [The Cognitive Integration and Information Transfer Relation (CIITR) vs Apple whitepaper – The Illusion of Thinking.pdf](2025.11.04%20-%20The%20Cognitive%20Integration%20and%20Information%20Transfer%20Relation%20(CIITR)%20vs%20Apple%20whitepaper%20-%20The%20Illusion%20of%20Thinking.pdf) | Comparative analysis mapping external empirical findings to CIITR | Analyzes Apple’s independent “The Illusion of Thinking” study through the CIITR framework, arguing that observed reasoning collapse and system anomalies correspond to predicted Rᵍ depletion in Type-B systems. Serves as an early demonstration of CIITR as a meta-evaluative and explanatory framework, prior to formal kernel closure and instrumentation standards. |
| 2025-11-03 | [CIITR Rᵍ – Toward Rhythmic and Energy-Efficient Artificial Intelligence.pdf](2025.11.03%20-%20CIITR%20Rg%20-%20Toward%20Rhythmic%20and%20Energy-Efficient%20Artificial%20Intelligence.pdf) | Applied whitepaper exploring Rᵍ as an architectural and energy principle | Extends CIITR into an applied, infrastructural context by treating rhythmic reach (Rᵍ) as a design variable for persistent, energy-efficient artificial systems. Represents an early application-oriented exploration of CIITR prior to kernel closure, translating rhythmic comprehension into data-center, grid, and sustainability considerations. |
| 2025-10-31 | [The Cognitive Integration and Information Transfer Relation (CIITR).pdf](2025.10.31%20-%20The%20Cognitive%20Integration%20and%20Information%20Transfer%20Relation%20(CIITR).pdf) | Early synthetic theory paper formalizing the CIITR relation | Presents the first unified formulation of CIITR as a structural and thermodynamic framework, contemporaneous with late-stage theory development prior to kernel closure. Establishes the Φᵢ–Rᵍ relation, the orthogonality barrier, and early links to thermodynamic persistence, serving as a bridge between conceptual forerunners and the later CIITR Core Specification. |
| 2025-10-26 | [The CIITR Self-Declarations – A Structural Discovery in Artificial Intelligence.pdf](2025.10.26%20-%20The%20CIITR%20Self-Declarations%20-%20A%20Structural%20Discovery%20in%20Artificial%20Intelligence.pdf) | Exploratory comparative paper using CIITR grammar for model self-description | Documents an early structural experiment in which multiple large language models describe their own architectures using CIITR concepts. Serves as a contemporaneous probe of CIITR as a shared introspective language, preceding formal kernel closure, instrumentation rules, and negative-evidence constraints. |
| 2025-10-22 | [The reflexive limit of artificial intelligence.pdf](2025.10.22%20-%20The%20reflexive%20limit%20of%20artificial%20intelligence.pdf) | Early conceptual essay on reflexivity, temporal structure, and limits of inference in artificial systems | Articulates the integration–reach distinction and the snapshot limitation problem contemporaneously with early CIITR development, prior to kernel formalization. Serves as a conceptual precursor to later CIITR principles concerning non-compensation, temporal invariance, and the separation between internal integration and externally coupled rhythmic re-entry. |

### Notes on interpretation

- Entries classified as *early*, *exploratory*, or *conceptual* should be read as part of the formative phase of CIITR, not as applications of a finalized kernel.
- Later theory notes and papers may explicitly reference the CIITR Kernel or Core Specification and will be described accordingly.
- No document listed here is retroactively modified to satisfy later formal criteria.
