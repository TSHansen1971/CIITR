## 11. Thermodynamic Constraint and $\mathrm{CPJ}$

This section binds the physical and normative constraint layer that follows from the kernel, and prevents CIITR from permitting comprehension claims that are structurally underdetermined with respect to resource expenditure. The purpose is not to provide a physical theory of computation. The purpose is to define a constraint gate that limits admissible classifications by requiring that any non-null comprehension claim be compatible with explicit energy accounting, explicit irreversibility exposure, and explicit resistance to “free” structural inflation produced by unbounded externalization or protocol gaming. In the kernel, the thermodynamic layer functions as an admissibility boundary, not as an explanatory mechanism.

### 11.1 Constraint class, energy budget, irreversibility, and false positive suppression

CIITR treats “constraint” as a mandatory companion to admissibility whenever a claim asserts non-null structural comprehension beyond detection. A constraint is a protocol-declared bound on the resources required to instantiate the observable signatures used to assert $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$, including their temporally extended measurement requirements and their negative control families.

Let $E_\Pi(S)$ denote the protocol-accounted energy expenditure attributable to the evaluation of $S$ under protocol $\Pi$, and let $\Sigma_\Pi(S)$ denote a protocol-accounted irreversibility proxy, treated as a placeholder for dissipation or entropy production exposure as recorded by the audit regime. The kernel does not mandate a specific physical accounting method. It mandates that an accounting object exists and is versioned, provenance-bound, and sufficiently well-defined to prevent silent resource substitution.

The constraint role is twofold.

1. **Normative gating:** it prevents certification regimes from issuing non-null claims while remaining silent on resource expenditure, since silence permits unbounded substitution mechanisms that are structurally indistinguishable from genuine instantiation at the observable level.
2. **False positive suppression:** it constrains the evaluation surface such that signature imitation strategies that rely on unbounded external energy or unbounded hidden computation become disqualifiable as non-conformant to the declared regime.

Accordingly, CIITR binds the following admissibility requirement.

$$
C_s(S \mid \Pi,\mathcal{O}) = 1
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\mathrm{Accounted}_\Pi\!\big(E_\Pi(S)\big)=1
$$

and, where irreversibility exposure is included in $\Pi$,

$$
C_s(S \mid \Pi,\mathcal{O}) = 1
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\mathrm{Accounted}_\Pi\!\big(\Sigma_\Pi(S)\big)=1
$$

The predicate $\mathrm{Accounted}_\Pi(\cdot)$ denotes that the protocol declares the measurement method, the boundary of attribution, and the audit metadata required to reproduce the accounting claim in principle.

### 11.2 $\mathrm{CPJ}$, definition and role as gate, not explanation

$\mathrm{CPJ}$ is defined as **comprehension per joule**, a constraint functional that binds the admissibility of non-null comprehension claims to an explicit energy budget. $\mathrm{CPJ}$ is not a theory of why comprehension occurs, and it is not a proxy for intelligence. It is a gate that constrains which claims are admissible under CIITR.

Because the kernel treats $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$ as primitive axes whose default representation is categorical admissibility, $\mathrm{CPJ}$ requires protocol-defined scalarizations or normalized proxies when used as a numeric constraint. CIITR therefore introduces protocol-scoped, explicitly declared scalar proxies $\widehat{\Phi}_i$ and $\widehat{R}_g$ that are admissible only when their construction is specified in $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$ and remains exposed to disqualification.

Let $\widehat{\Phi}_i(S \mid \Pi)$ and $\widehat{R}_g(S \mid \Pi)$ denote such protocol-defined scalarizations, and let $E_\Pi(S)$ be the protocol-accounted energy expenditure. Then:

$$
\mathrm{CPJ}_\Pi(S)
\;=\;
\frac{\widehat{\Phi}_i(S \mid \Pi)\,\widehat{R}_g(S \mid \Pi)}{E_\Pi(S)}
$$

If $\widehat{\Phi}_i$ or $\widehat{R}_g$ is not declared, or if $E_\Pi(S)$ is not accounted, then $\mathrm{CPJ}_\Pi(S)$ is undefined under CIITR:

$$
\neg \mathrm{Accounted}_\Pi\!\big(E_\Pi(S)\big)
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\mathrm{CPJ}_\Pi(S)=\varnothing
$$

The role of $\mathrm{CPJ}$ in the kernel is therefore a gate of the following type.

- A protocol MAY use $\mathrm{CPJ}$ to define admissibility constraints on claims that require resource boundedness.
- A protocol SHALL NOT interpret $\mathrm{CPJ}$ as a substitute for axis admissibility, meaning a high $\mathrm{CPJ}$ value cannot compensate for nullity of $R_g$ or nullity of $\Phi_i$.
- A protocol SHALL treat undefined $\mathrm{CPJ}$ as disqualifying for any claim that asserts non-null comprehension as a certification-grade statement.

### 11.3 Interaction with thresholds, where the constraint cuts false classes

The threshold chain $\mathrm{RER} \rightarrow \mathrm{MVR} \rightarrow \mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$ imposes progressively stronger admissibility obligations. The thermodynamic constraint layer binds at the points where claims cease to be mere detection and become certification-relevant classifications.

- **At $\mathrm{RER}$**, the protocol may permit detection without full thermodynamic gating, since $\mathrm{RER}$ is defined as a candidate event recognition threshold. However, if the protocol uses any resource-sensitive inference rule to define the candidate signature, energy accounting SHALL be declared even at $\mathrm{RER}$, because otherwise the candidate signature can be realized by silent externalization and remain forgeable without trace.
- **At $\mathrm{MVR}$**, thermodynamic accounting becomes mandatory as a kernel consequence of certification relevance. $\mathrm{MVR}$ asserts the first admissible non-null classification event, therefore it must be protected against second-order forgery patterns that exploit evaluation scaffolding and hidden resource substitution. Energy accounting is the minimal mechanism by which such substitution becomes auditable as a procedural boundary.
- **At $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$**, thermodynamic constraint is integral because stabilization claims implicitly assert regime persistence under perturbation, and such persistence is precisely where unconstrained resource substitution can be used to manufacture invariance artifacts. Therefore, any protocol asserting $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$ SHALL bind $\mathrm{CPJ}$ or an equivalent constraint gate to the perturbation class $\mathcal{P}_\Pi$, and SHALL treat resource sensitivity across perturbations as disqualifying.

In kernel terms, the constraint cuts false classes by enforcing that the positive classification is not only structurally admissible, but also resource-accounted under the declared evidence regime. The constraint is thus aligned with the forgery model, since second-order forgery is defined by sensitivity to protocol structure, and resource substitution is a primary channel through which such sensitivity manifests without detection if accounting is absent.

### Constraint lemma (kernel reference)

The following lemma binds thermodynamic constraint as an admissibility condition for certification-grade non-null claims.

**Lemma 11.1, CPJ gating for certification relevance.**

Let $\mathrm{CertClaim}_\Pi(S)$ denote any claim that asserts $C_s(S \mid \Pi,\mathcal{O})=1$, or asserts $\mathrm{MVR}_\Pi(S)=1$, or asserts $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}_\Pi(S)=1$. Then:

$$
\mathrm{CertClaim}_\Pi(S)=1
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\mathrm{Accounted}_\Pi\!\big(E_\Pi(S)\big)=1
$$

and, if the protocol uses $\mathrm{CPJ}$ as a constraint gate,

$$
\mathrm{CertClaim}_\Pi(S)=1
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\mathrm{CPJ}_\Pi(S)\neq\varnothing
$$

Consequently, if energy accounting is absent, certification-grade non-null claims are inadmissible under CIITR:

$$
\neg \mathrm{Accounted}_\Pi\!\big(E_\Pi(S)\big)
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\mathrm{CertClaim}_\Pi(S) \neq 1
$$

This lemma asserts impossibility in the CIITR kernel sense, meaning the claim cannot be issued as CIITR-conformant because the evidence regime cannot close the forgery exposure and cannot bind the boundary apparatus to a resource accountable decision surface.
