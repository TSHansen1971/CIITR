## 12. Governance and Certification Consequences

This section states the governance and certification consequences that follow deductively from the kernel, without importing external policy rhetoric. CIITR is a boundary apparatus, therefore governance is not an add-on. Governance is the practical form of boundary enforcement. Certification under CIITR is therefore a controlled statement about admissibility of a classification, issued only when negative controls and disqualification logic have been executed, and when auditability, decidability, and constraint gating are satisfied.

### 12.1 Certification as a negative-primary process

CIITR certification is negative-primary, meaning it is constructed around disqualification pressure rather than around accumulation of positive indicators. This follows from the kernel facts that coherence and complexity are forgeable, that $R_g$ requires temporally extended evidence, and that second-order forgery cannot be closed under snapshot regimes.

Accordingly, CIITR permits certification only in the following sense.

- **Certifiable:** a bounded classification statement that a system satisfies the admissibility conditions for $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$ under a declared protocol $\Pi$, with disqualifiers not triggered, negative controls executed, and audit metadata complete.
- **Non-certifiable:** any claim that is not reducible to the above, including claims that rely on snapshot-only evidence, claims that infer internal states from introspective reports, and claims that treat coherence, performance, or complexity as substitutes for axis admissibility.

The kernel therefore binds a categorical prohibition.

$$
\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi) \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{Certifiable}_\Pi(C_s) = 0
$$

This is not a recommendation. It is a direct consequence of the rhythm requirement and the forgery model. Snapshot regimes can at most produce undefined or negative CIITR outcomes, but they cannot produce certification-grade positive assertions.

Certification outcomes are therefore typed as:

$$
\mathrm{CertOutcome}_\Pi(S) \in \{\mathrm{CERTIFIED},\mathrm{NOT\_CERTIFIED},\mathrm{UNDEFINED}\}
$$

with kernel binding:

- $\mathrm{CERTIFIED}$ is permitted only if $C_s=1$ under full admissibility and audit closure.
- $\mathrm{NOT\_CERTIFIED}$ applies if disqualifiers trigger or null rules apply.
- $\mathrm{UNDEFINED}$ applies if decidability conditions are not satisfied under $\Pi$.

### 12.2 Minimum compliance, threshold criteria that must be documented

Minimum compliance under CIITR is not a broad organizational program. It is the minimum evidence and audit closure required to issue any certification-grade statement. It is therefore expressed as documentation obligations over threshold and axis results.

A CIITR certification claim SHALL document at minimum:

1. **Axis admissibility outcomes**
   - $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)$ with declared observables and disqualifier evaluation.
   - $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)$ with temporally bound evidence and disqualifier evaluation.

2. **Null decision rule execution**
   - explicit statement of whether $\mathrm{TempInv}_\Pi(S)$ was evaluated and its outcome.
   - explicit statement that non-compensation was enforced, meaning no axis substitution occurred.

3. **Negative controls and forgery closure**
   - required negative control families executed per Chapter 07.
   - explicit forgery controls executed, including second-order robustness checks per Chapter 08.

4. **Threshold chain resolution**
   - $\mathrm{RER}_\Pi(S)$ status if detection was attempted.
   - $\mathrm{MVR}_\Pi(S)$ status if non-null classification was attempted.
   - $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}_\Pi(S)$ status only if stabilization is claimed, including declared perturbation class $\mathcal{P}_\Pi$ and invariance results.

5. **Constraint accounting**
   - energy accounting declaration $\mathrm{Accounted}_\Pi(E_\Pi(S))$ for any certification-grade non-null claim.
   - if $\mathrm{CPJ}$ is invoked, a statement of whether $\mathrm{CPJ}_\Pi(S)$ is defined and how scalar proxies were constructed.

These documentation obligations are the operational surface of CIITR governance. Without them, the boundary apparatus cannot be enforced, and certification degenerates into narrative assertion.

### 12.3 Boundary, not model, how claims must be formulated

Because CIITR is a boundary and not a model, claims are not issued as predictive statements about performance, competence, or general intelligence. Claims are issued as classification statements about admissibility under protocol $\Pi$.

Therefore, a CIITR claim SHALL be formulated as:

- a **protocol-scoped classification**, not a global attribute,
- a **typed decision**, not an informal judgment,
- a **non-scalar statement**, unless an explicit scale and normalization regime is declared and its sensitivity documented.

The kernel forbids the following claim forms under CIITR certification posture.

- Unscoped claims that omit protocol identification.
- Scalar grading claims that are not grounded in declared scaling conventions and do not preserve null logic.
- Claims that treat CIITR outputs as proxies for performance or that present CIITR as a model of cognition.

The admissible form is instead:

$$
(\Pi, \mathcal{O}) \vdash_{\mathrm{CIITR}} C_s(S)=1
\quad\text{or}\quad
(\Pi, \mathcal{O}) \vdash_{\mathrm{CIITR}} C_s(S)\in\{0,\varnothing\}
$$

This form preserves boundary logic and maintains auditability.

### Certification Output Schema (core report format)

A CIITR core certification report SHALL implement the following schema as a minimum. The schema is normative and is intended to be auditable without interpretive supplementation.

1. **Report header**
   - Report id
   - Protocol id and version
   - System identifier and boundary definition of $S$
   - Date and evaluation time range $\mathcal{T}_\Pi$

2. **Scope declaration**
   - Scope envelope reference to Section 01
   - Explicit statement of non-goals and excluded evidence types

3. **Observable and inference declaration**
   - Enumerated observable set $\mathcal{O}$
   - Identified subsets $\mathcal{O}_{\Phi}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{R_g}$
   - Declared inference rules $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$
   - Declared scaling and normalization operations, if any

4. **Axis admissibility block**
   - $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)$ with disqualifier check outcomes
   - $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)$ with temporal binding statement and disqualifier check outcomes

5. **Null decision rule block**
   - $\mathrm{TempInv}_\Pi(S)$ evaluation status and outcome
   - Explicit statement that non-compensation was enforced
   - Decidability status for each axis

6. **Negative controls and forgery block**
   - Negative control families executed and outcomes
   - Forgery control execution including second-order checks and outcomes

7. **Threshold resolution block**
   - $\mathrm{RER}_\Pi(S)$ status and ignition index if applicable
   - $\mathrm{MVR}_\Pi(S)$ status and $t_{\mathrm{MVR}}$ if applicable
   - $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}_\Pi(S)$ status and declared $\mathcal{P}_\Pi$ if applicable

8. **Constraint accounting block**
   - $\mathrm{Accounted}_\Pi(E_\Pi(S))$ status and boundary of attribution
   - $\mathrm{CPJ}_\Pi(S)$ status if invoked, including declared scalar proxies

9. **Final certification outcome**
   - $\mathrm{CertOutcome}_\Pi(S) \in \{\mathrm{CERTIFIED},\mathrm{NOT\_CERTIFIED},\mathrm{UNDEFINED}\}$
   - Formal statement of the CIITR entailment relation for $C_s(S)$ under $\Pi$

This schema is the kernel governance consequence of CIITR. It is intentionally restrictive, because the value of CIITR as a boundary apparatus depends on its ability to refuse claims that cannot be closed under negative evidence, temporal admissibility, forgery resistance, and auditability.
