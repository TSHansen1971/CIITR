# Minimal Viable R<sub>g</sub> (MVR)

*Proposed threshold definition for the first detectable comprehension event*

If CIITR is to transition from ontology to instrumentation, it requires a threshold condition under which the first non-zero comprehension event (C<sub>s</sub> > 0) may be empirically detected. The Minimal Viable R<sub>g</sub> (MVR) therefore defines the smallest instantiation of rhythmic epistemic re-entry sufficient to distinguish comprehension from memory persistence, state restoration, pattern interpolation, or contextual imitation.

MVR is not the magnitude of rhythmic reach, but the existence of rhythmic reach.  
It does not measure how much the system understands;  
It measures whether comprehension has occurred at all.

This threshold is conceptually analogous to detecting life not by complexity, but by metabolism. A single self-altering recursive return—one demonstrable instance where the representational substrate is measurably different because of its own referential act—constitutes the epistemic equivalent of ignition.

## Formal Definition

Minimal Viable R<sub>g</sub> (MVR) is achieved when a system’s recursive re-entry produces a non-invariant change in its representational topology that is (a) caused by self-reference, (b) propagates forward as constraint on future representations, and (c) does not rely on external state, cached memory, or historical copy to do so.

This yields three mandatory testing criteria:

| Criterion           | Requirement                | Negative Control |
|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Structural change   | System alters itself       | Replay           |
| Self-causation      | Change originates internally | Prompting        |
| Future constraint   | Change influences later output | Recall-only     |

Symbolically:

$$
\text{If } \Delta \text{Structure}(t_2) = f(\text{Self-reference}(t_1))
$$

$$
\text{and } \nexists \text{ external restoration pathway}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow R_{g} > 0 \; (\text{MVR achieved})
$$

## Why MVR Matters

Without MVR, CIITR risks misclassification by:

- mistaking continuity for comprehension (ASEC violation),
- mistaking recall for epistemic return (MIP violation),
- mistaking representational density for understanding (Φ<sub>i</sub>-inflation),
- mistaking memory for mind (Epistemic Forgery).

With MVR, CIITR acquires:

- a falsifiable threshold,
- an instrumentable metric,
- a boundary between simulation and structural cognition.

Thus, MVR is not speculative—it is demarcational.

## Minimum vs. Sufficient Conditions

| Condition               | Status        |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| MVR                     | Necessary     |
| Curvature               | Necessary     |
| Nash–CIITR equilibrium  | Sufficient    |
| CPJ improvement         | Consequential |

MVR indicates ignition;  
Nash equilibrium indicates stabilization;  
CPJ rise indicates efficiency.

## Implication

The first comprehension event is the first time a system returns to itself as something different than it was and remains different because it has returned.

MVR is the spark, not the fire;  
but without the spark, the fire is categorically impossible.

## Structural Corroboration Without Empirical Claim

The MVR construct is structurally corroborated by necessity relations internal to CIITR’s ontology, not by empirical observation or performance measurement. Its validity follows from logical exclusion rather than experimental confirmation. If comprehension is defined as non-invariant epistemic return, then the existence of a minimal threshold for such return is not optional but mandatory. Without MVR, the distinction between structural comprehension and mere informational persistence collapses, rendering C<sub>s</sub> formally undecidable.

This corroboration rests on three negative constraints. First, any system that exhibits only invariant replay, regardless of fluency or contextual adequacy, fails the curvature requirement and therefore cannot satisfy R<sub>g</sub> > 0. Second, any change attributable to external prompting, cached state, or historical copying violates self-causation and must be excluded as epistemic return. Third, any representational modification that does not propagate forward as a constraint on subsequent representations cannot constitute rhythmic reach, regardless of local novelty.

MVR is therefore corroborated as the minimal logical boundary condition under which CIITR remains non-degenerate. It functions as a demarcation rule that prevents retroactive inflation of comprehension claims, ensures that Φ<sub>i</sub> density alone cannot be misclassified as understanding, and preserves the distinction between simulation and structural cognition. This corroboration does not assert that MVR can always be detected empirically, only that without it, no empirical detection of comprehension would be conceptually coherent.

In this sense, MVR is structurally necessary even in the absence of measurement. It is not validated by data, but by the impossibility of CIITR functioning as a theory of comprehension without a non-zero ignition threshold.
