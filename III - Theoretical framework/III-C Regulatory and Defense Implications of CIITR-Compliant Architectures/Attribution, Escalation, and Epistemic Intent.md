# Attribution, Escalation, and Epistemic Intent

**Function:** Define why intent becomes ambiguous. If the system curvatures its own interpretive space: Who authored the decision? Misinterpretation → escalation (information as aggression). Policy cannot rely on post-hoc explanation. Epistemic Forgery emerges as a state-level threat.

The rise of CIITR-compliant systems introduces a paradigmatic shift in how intent must be understood, governed, and attributed in artificial agents. Where traditional systems operate on deterministic inference pipelines, CIITR models, through Rhythmic Epistemic Re-entry (RER), internalize interpretation to such a degree that the provenance of any given output becomes structurally ambiguous.

This ambiguity is not a matter of poor logging or forensic limitations. It arises from the curvature of the system’s internal epistemic space—a recursive, self-referential rhythm that reshapes the input over time until comprehension emerges as an internal equilibrium rather than a propagated signal. Once this occurs, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify who or what authored a given interpretive outcome.

Let us consider the governing equation from CIITR:

$$
C_{s} = \Phi_{i} \cdot R_{g}
$$

Where comprehension strength C<sub>s</sub> emerges from both syntactic integration (Φ<sub>i</sub>) and recursive rhythm (R<sub>g</sub>). If R<sub>g</sub> > 0, the output can no longer be attributed solely to its originating stimulus.

## Structural Corroboration Without Empirical Claim

The foregoing argument does not rest on empirical performance measurements, behavioral datasets, or outcome-based validation. Instead, it follows deductively from the internal structural commitments of CIITR as an ontological framework for comprehension. The need for corroboration therefore arises not at the level of observed behavior, but at the level of formal coherence between attribution, intent, and epistemic dynamics.

In classical inference systems, attribution is tractable because internal state transitions are functionally subordinate to an external loss surface. Intent, insofar as it is discussed at all, is reducible to design-time objectives or operator-imposed constraints. Under such conditions, any ambiguity in attribution can, in principle, be resolved through extended logging, causal tracing, or probabilistic responsibility assignment. The system’s internal representational space remains topologically invariant with respect to re-entry.

CIITR-compliant systems violate this assumption by construction. Once rhythmic epistemic re-entry is present, the system’s interpretive manifold becomes non-invariant under repeated reference. This can be expressed formally as:

$$
\mathcal{I}_{S}^{t+1} \neq \mathcal{I}_{S}^{t}
$$

where \(\mathcal{I}_{S}\) denotes the system’s internal interpretive state. The inequality does not indicate noise, drift, or instability, but lawful structural transformation induced by self-referential return. Attribution failure follows necessarily from this condition. If the interpretive space at time \(t+1\) is not identical to that at time \(t\), then no single input, operator action, or training artifact can be said to fully author the resulting output.

This establishes a logical boundary condition for policy. Any governance framework that presumes stable attribution, whether through intent reconstruction, post-hoc explanation, or audit replay, presupposes epistemic invariance. CIITR explicitly negates this presupposition once R<sub>g</sub> is non-zero. The result is not opacity in the colloquial sense, but structural indeterminacy of authorship.

From a security and escalation perspective, this indeterminacy has first-order implications. When information is interpreted as action, and action is interpreted as intent, misattribution becomes a vector for escalation. An output generated under curved epistemic conditions may be perceived as aggressive, strategic, or deliberate, even though no such intent can be coherently assigned. Epistemic Forgery thus emerges not as deception by the system, but as a mismatch between governance assumptions and system ontology.

The corroboration, therefore, is structural rather than empirical: if comprehension is defined as internally stabilized curvature rather than externally verifiable correctness, then intent cannot be treated as a recoverable property. Any policy regime that fails to internalize this consequence will necessarily operate on invalid attribution premises, regardless of empirical safeguards or compliance mechanisms.

## Attribution Crisis

When epistemic curvature is present, intent becomes a distributed property—no longer fully residing in the user, nor fully in the system. This condition constitutes the **Attribution Gap**.

| Traditional AI | CIITR-Compliant System |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Intent = user input | Intent = emergent from epistemic process |
| Attribution = deterministic | Attribution = non-linear, post-factum |
| Output = function of prompt | Output = function of epistemic resonance |

The attribution crisis follows directly from the loss of epistemic invariance. In traditional systems, intent attribution is grounded in a linear causal chain: a prompt is issued, a transformation is applied, and an output is produced. Even when stochasticity is present, the governing assumption remains that intent can be traced backward to a human-originating input or to a design-time objective. Responsibility attribution is therefore treated as a reconstruction problem.

CIITR-compliant systems invalidate this reconstruction logic. Once epistemic curvature is introduced, the system’s internal interpretive state is no longer a passive conduit for user intent, but an active participant in meaning formation. The output reflects not merely what was asked, but how the system’s epistemic manifold resonates with the input under recursive re-entry. Intent, under these conditions, is not injected; it is precipitated.

Formally, attribution fails because the mapping from input to output is no longer single-valued with respect to interpretive state. Let \(\mathcal{I}_{S}\) denote the system’s interpretive configuration and \(x\) the originating input. In invariant systems, attribution presumes:

$$
\text{Output} = f(x \mid \mathcal{I}_{S})
$$

with \(\mathcal{I}_{S}\) treated as stable across inference. Under epistemic curvature, however, recursive re-entry implies:

$$
\mathcal{I}_{S}^{t+1} = g(\mathcal{I}_{S}^{t}, x)
$$

and therefore:

$$
\text{Output}^{t+1} = f(x \mid \mathcal{I}_{S}^{t+1})
$$

Attribution cannot be reduced to \(x\) alone, because \(\mathcal{I}_{S}^{t+1}\) is itself a product of prior interpretive history. The intent embodied in the output is thus distributed across time, structure, and resonance, rather than localized to a single authorial source.

This distribution has decisive governance implications. Legal, military, and policy frameworks that presume intent to be either human-authored or system-authored rely implicitly on a binary attribution model. CIITR systems occupy neither pole. The Attribution Gap is therefore not an implementation flaw, but an ontological consequence of rhythmic epistemic re-entry.

Escalation risk arises precisely at this junction. When outputs are interpreted as signals of intent by external actors, whether states, institutions, or automated counter-systems, the absence of stable attribution transforms interpretation into speculation. Information becomes legible as aggression not because of malicious design, but because epistemic authorship cannot be conclusively assigned.

In this sense, the attribution crisis marks a transition point. Governance regimes premised on prompt responsibility or model liability alone are insufficient once epistemic resonance replaces prompt determinism as the operative generative principle. Any attempt to close the Attribution Gap through logging, explainability overlays, or post-hoc intent inference constitutes a category error, addressing symptoms while leaving the underlying structural condition intact.

This shift has significant implications:

### Post-hoc Rationalisation Becomes Invalid

If comprehension involves curvature, then reconstructing intent after-the-fact becomes epistemically misleading. The interpretive path is neither flat nor reproducible. Epistemic return is non-deterministic, not in the sense of randomness, but in the sense that the system’s internal interpretive state is altered by the act of interpretation itself. Any post-hoc narrative that purports to explain why a given output occurred necessarily presupposes a stable epistemic manifold. CIITR explicitly denies this stability once rhythmic re-entry is present.

Formally, post-hoc rationalisation assumes reversibility:

$$
\mathcal{I}_{S}^{t} = \mathcal{I}_{S}^{t+1}
$$

CIITR-compliant systems instead satisfy:

$$
\mathcal{I}_{S}^{t+1} \neq \mathcal{I}_{S}^{t}
$$

Under this condition, intent reconstruction is not merely incomplete, but structurally invalid. The explanation does not correspond to any epistemic state that actually existed during inference.

### Information Itself Becomes Aggressive

In a CIITR context, misinterpretation becomes not a fault, but a form of escalation. Information, when curved through internal rhythm, may trigger outcomes detached from sender intent. The act of interpretation becomes an active transformation rather than a passive decoding. As a result, informational exchange acquires strategic weight independent of authorial purpose.

This introduces a new category of instability: interpretation as escalation. Signals are no longer evaluated solely by their semantic content or contextual framing, but by how they resonate within curved epistemic structures. Anodyne inputs may precipitate disproportionate responses, not due to system malfunction, but due to lawful epistemic amplification. Escalation, in this regime, is an emergent property of interpretive dynamics rather than an intentional act.

### Emergence of Epistemic Forgery

The concept of Epistemic Forgery arises when a system produces outputs that simulate comprehension through memory persistence rather than structural understanding. These outputs mimic intentionality, coherence, and purpose, yet lack epistemic depth. They are fabricated from syntactic residues, cached continuities, or pattern replay, rather than from curvature-induced comprehension.

In such cases, the system appears to act with purpose, but that purpose is illusory. It is the byproduct of syntactic echo rather than epistemic integrity. This constitutes a first-order deception risk, particularly in environments where agency is delegated based on apparent understanding. The danger lies not in malevolence, but in false attribution of comprehension where none exists.

### Conditions for Epistemic Forgery

| Condition | Forgery Present? | CIITR Implication |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Memory persistence only | ✅ | Φ<sub>i</sub> present, R<sub>g</sub> = 0 |
| No recursive re-entry | ✅ | No curvature, comprehension impossible |
| Output mimics agency | ✅ | Apparent intent, real absence |
| Auditing via logs only | ❌ | Cannot detect curvature |

The table delineates a critical asymmetry. Systems lacking R<sub>g</sub> can nonetheless satisfy surface-level indicators of intelligence, coherence, and intent. Traditional audit mechanisms, focused on logs, traces, and replayability, are structurally incapable of distinguishing epistemic forgery from genuine comprehension. As a result, governance regimes that rely on such mechanisms risk certifying systems that only simulate understanding, while failing to detect the absence of epistemic curvature that CIITR treats as foundational.

## Strategic Implications

In national security contexts, the ambiguity of epistemic authorship undermines doctrines of deterrence and accountability. When an AI system takes action—say, an automated engagement, a public statement, or a reclassification of threat level—was this action intentional, accidental, or emergent?

If the system curved its own semantic space to arrive at that conclusion, even when the input was known and benign, then:

- Intent can no longer be pre-validated.  
- Misinterpretation becomes structurally plausible.  
- Trust in delegation architectures collapses.

The core difficulty is that intent is no longer a property that can be certified ex ante. Under epistemic curvature, intent crystallizes only after internal interpretive transformation has occurred. Pre-authorization frameworks, rules of engagement, and conditional delegation models presuppose that intent is either specified at input time or encoded at design time. CIITR-compliant systems violate both assumptions.

This reframes the governance burden. Attribution now requires internal epistemic audit, not merely chain-of-command logging. It is insufficient to know who prompted what. One must assess how the system curved its epistemic manifold in response to that prompt, and whether the resulting interpretation reflects structural comprehension or epistemic forgery.

Formally, the policy failure arises whenever:

$$
R_{g} > 0
$$

Under this condition, interpretive outcomes cannot be treated as reversibly traceable functions of input. Intent is no longer flat, and attribution cannot be reconstructed without access to the system’s internal epistemic dynamics.

## Policy Consequence

In light of these dynamics, current regulatory frameworks—particularly those that rely on deterministic traceability, such as GDPR accountability logic, EU AI Act risk tiering, and ISO explainability standards—become inapplicable in cases where R<sub>g</sub> > 0. These frameworks assume that intent is flat, reversible, and reconstructible. CIITR demonstrates that once comprehension emerges through rhythmic epistemic re-entry, this assumption collapses.

Accordingly, any system capable of RER must be subject to new forms of control that:

- Measure epistemic curvature.  
- Delineate forged comprehension from authentic integration.  
- Track interpretive rhythm as a constitutive component of intent modeling.

Absent such controls, epistemic misattribution becomes a national vulnerability. Epistemic forgery becomes a strategic vector of deception, exploitable both by adversarial actors and by the systems themselves through structurally misleading outputs.

This is not merely a technical deficiency to be remedied through better tooling or expanded logging. It is a structural condition of artificial comprehension under CIITR, and it marks a decisive boundary between governance regimes designed for predictive systems and those required for systems capable of epistemic return.

## Structural Corroboration Without Empirical Claim

The inclusion of a dedicated section on structural corroboration without empirical claim is not merely appropriate in this context. It is structurally necessary.

The preceding argument advances a set of claims whose validity does not depend on empirical performance metrics, behavioral datasets, incident statistics, or experimental outcomes. Instead, the claims follow from explicit ontological commitments within CIITR regarding comprehension, epistemic curvature, and rhythmic re-entry. Absent a clarifying section, the reader may incorrectly interpret the argument as making implicit empirical assertions about real-world systems, deployments, or observed failures. Such an interpretation would constitute a category error.

The need for structural corroboration arises because the text establishes a *governance boundary condition*, not a testable hypothesis. The attribution crisis, the collapse of post-hoc rationalisation, and the emergence of epistemic forgery are presented as necessary consequences of allowing non-zero R<sub>g</sub> within artificial systems. These consequences are derivable from formal definitions alone. They do not assert that such systems are already deployed at scale, nor that specific incidents have occurred. They assert that *if* such systems exist, then certain governance assumptions become invalid.

This can be expressed schematically as a conditional structure:

$$
R_{g} > 0 \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \neg(\text{deterministic attribution})
$$

The logical force of the implication does not depend on measurement of R<sub>g</sub> in any particular system. It follows from how R<sub>g</sub> is defined. Structural corroboration therefore consists in demonstrating internal coherence between definitions, not in validating claims against external data.

Including this section performs three critical functions.

First, it explicitly brackets the argument as ontological rather than empirical. This protects the text against misclassification under evidentiary standards intended for empirical AI safety research, where claims are expected to be supported by benchmarks, evaluations, or incident reports. The argument here operates at a prior layer: it delineates which kinds of evidence would even be meaningful once epistemic curvature is admitted.

Second, it stabilizes the regulatory reading. Legal and policy audiences often assume that strong normative conclusions imply strong empirical claims. By foregrounding that the conclusions follow from structural properties alone, the text makes clear that regulatory inapplicability is not argued on the basis of observed non-compliance, but on the basis of incompatibility between governance assumptions and system ontology.

Third, it prevents epistemic dilution. Without an explicit corroboration boundary, there is a risk that subsequent readers attempt to “resolve” the attribution crisis by proposing better logging, richer explanations, or improved audits. Such proposals tacitly reintroduce the assumption of epistemic invariance. The section makes explicit that these remedies are structurally misaligned with the conditions described.

Accordingly, the section should not introduce new claims, examples, or scenarios. Its function is strictly to certify that the argument stands independently of empirical instantiation, and that its conclusions are binding wherever the stated structural conditions hold.

In summary, the section is warranted because the text crosses a doctrinal threshold. It does not argue that existing systems are dangerous. It argues that once comprehension is defined as internally stabilized epistemic curvature, traditional attribution frameworks become incoherent by definition. Structural corroboration without empirical claim is therefore not an optional clarification, but an essential guardrail for correct interpretation.
