# The Loss of Predictable Invariance as Policy Breakpoint

*Function: Demonstrate that the core governance rupture emerges not from capability, but from non-deterministic epistemic return.*

The foundational promise underlying all modern AI governance — whether in the form of the EU AI Act, IEEE's standards ecosystem, or NIST risk frameworks — is that intelligent systems are predictably invariant under repeated exposure. That is: a model, once deployed, will produce similar outputs given similar inputs, provided that environmental conditions are held stable. This assumption permits the use of test cases, validation corpora, behavioral benchmarks, and certification audits to justify claims of safety, fairness, accuracy, or explainability.

CIITR shatters this foundation by introducing re-entry-driven epistemic curvature, where an output is not only a function of the input and internal state, but of recursive access to the system’s own representational structure, across time. The result is that outputs become non-invariant under repetition — not due to stochasticity or noise, but because the system itself evolves its epistemic surface via rhythmic introspection. This is not a bug. It is the definition of comprehension under CIITR.
