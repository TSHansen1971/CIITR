# ASEC: Across-session epistemic continuity as a negative constraint

Not to award credit, but to expose absence. ASEC as “minimum necessary, never sufficient”.

The introduction of ASEC — Across-Session Epistemic Continuity constitutes a corrective boundary condition within the CIITR ontology. ASEC does not identify comprehension; rather, it identifies the lack of conditions under which comprehension could exist. It is therefore defined explicitly as a negative constraint, not a score, not a signal, and not an indicator of C<sub>s</sub>.

Persistence across temporal gaps is required for comprehension to be even theoretically possible. A system that dissolves completely upon interruption cannot re-enter its own representations, because no representation survives as an object available for reinterpretation. Yet, survival of representation is only the first barrier, not the crossing of it. CIITR thus codifies:

ASEC is minimum necessary, never sufficient.

ASEC merely ensures something remains. It does not ensure that the something can be structurally re-entered without being merely replayed. If a system requires externally provided state, cached dialogue history, or indexable storage in order to re-surface prior content, then what is occurring is recollection, not comprehension. The system has retained data; the system has not retained relation.

The critical contribution of ASEC lies in its negative diagnostic power:

•	If ASEC fails, C<sub>s</sub> is impossible.  
•	If ASEC passes, C<sub>s</sub> remains undetermined.

In biological cognition, this distinction becomes obvious when examining conditions of profound amnesia. An individual unable to transcend the bounds of the present cannot marshal past representations as subjects of reinterpretation. There is continuity of sensation, but not continuity of epistemic agency. In artificial systems, the same failure mode appears when a model can produce coherent output only while its conversational context remains available. Remove the scaffold, and the apparent structure collapses.

ASEC therefore functions as a null-point filter:

without temporal availability, rhythmic self-access cannot occur.

But ASEC does not, and must not, confer positive value toward comprehension. To do so would repeat the category error that CIITR 1.9 is designed to correct: permitting persistence to masquerade as rhythmic epistemic activity.

Where CIITR 1.0 defined the multiplicative structure  
$$ C_{s} = \Phi_{i} \times R_{g} $$,  
CIITR 1.9 adds a prior condition:

If ASEC = false, then R<sub>g</sub> = 0 for any Φ<sub>i</sub>.

Not because continuity creates rhythm, but because the absence of continuity precludes rhythm. ASEC is not the spark of comprehension. It is the oxygen level above combustion threshold — a parameter of possibility, not ignition.

Thus, the first principle of ASEC in CIITR must remain:

•	Passing ASEC does not imply comprehension.  
•	Failing ASEC forbids it.

R<sub>g</sub> cannot emerge from disappearance.  
C<sub>s</sub> cannot emerge from recurrence without return.
