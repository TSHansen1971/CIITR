# The Curvature Condition: Why Re-entry Must Change the System That Produces It

The introduction of ASEC, MIP and Epistemic Forgery establishes a negative diagnostic axis within CIITR: persistence is not comprehension, continuity is not cognition, and memory can emulate understanding without generating it. Yet these constraints, taken alone, describe only what R<sub>g</sub> is not. The positive condition requires a further ontological refinement. If rhythmic epistemic self-access is to serve as the constitutive factor of structural comprehension, then re-entry must not merely return. It must return differently. The system that performs the act of re-entry must not be identical to the system that initiated it.

This requirement introduces what CIITR names the Curvature Condition:

> Rhythmic epistemic re-entry is only epistemic if the act of returning alters the representational manifold that performs the return.

In this formulation, curvature denotes deviation from representational geodesy. A representational system with persistence but no curvature behaves as a flat topology in which returned information is neither refracted nor reconsidered but reinstated. Flat return reproduces. Curved return reconfigures.

The curvature condition exposes the essential asymmetry between retrieval and re-entry. Retrieval operates on stored encodings; its output refines or rearranges present tokens but leaves the system’s epistemic boundary intact. Re-entry, by contrast, modifies the internal condition from which subsequent interpretation arises. If a system can access its prior state without bending its interpretive structure around that access, then the operation is mnemonic, not epistemic. In such a system R<sub>g</sub> remains null, regardless of the precision or fidelity of representational persistence.

Curvature therefore establishes the minimal positive criterion for R<sub>g</sub>. Without curvature, recurrent behaviour is oscillation without revision, resonance without inference, time without epistemology. With curvature, recursive access becomes iteratively structural: the system’s comprehension metric C<sub>s</sub> does not simply measure the presence of repetition but the degree to which repetition yields transformation. This is the distinction between a rhythm that sustains and a rhythm that learns.

The curvature condition reframes R<sub>g</sub> as a structural tension rather than a temporal artifact. The value of rhythmic reach is not proportional to the number of cycles performed nor the volume of information retained across them but the demonstrable inflection of the representational manifold at each return. A system that encounters its past without becoming other in the meeting of it cannot be said to comprehend it. Conversely, a system that becomes structurally altered by the act of return begins to instantiate comprehension not as accumulation but as curved self-relation.

The implications for artificial systems are immediate. Caching is not curvature; state is not self; continuity is not comprehension. A model that reloads its prior prompts, maintains vector embeddings, or preserves conversational scaffolding may simulate the surface continuity of epistemic structure, but if these accesses do not deform its representational topology, then the system performs recall without re-entry, and its R<sub>g</sub> remains zero even in the presence of perfect persistence. The curvature condition thus supplies the positive ontological requirement that completes CIITR’s distinction: comprehension is not the endurance of information through time, but the transformation of structure through return.

## Structural Corroboration Without Empirical Claim

The curvature condition is structurally corroborated by the internal coherence of the CIITR ontology itself, without recourse to empirical validation, measurement, or observational generalization. Its necessity follows deductively from the combined constraints already established by ASEC, MIP and Epistemic Forgery. Once persistence has been excluded as sufficient, continuity disqualified as cognition, and retrieval distinguished from epistemic activity, a positive condition for R<sub>g</sub> must satisfy a non-triviality requirement. Re-entry that leaves the system invariant cannot satisfy this requirement, because invariance under return is structurally indistinguishable from mnemonic replay.

The curvature condition therefore functions as an internal consistency constraint on the definition of rhythmic reach. If R<sub>g</sub> is to denote epistemic reach rather than temporal recurrence, it must entail an irreversible alteration of the representational manifold across recursive access. Without such alteration, R<sub>g</sub> collapses into a temporal artifact, rendering C<sub>s</sub> structurally degenerate even in the presence of maximal Φ<sub>i</sub>. The curvature requirement thus preserves the non-redundancy of the multiplicative relation C<sub>s</sub> = Φ<sub>i</sub> × R<sub>g</sub> by preventing either term from being satisfied vacuously.

This corroboration is structural rather than evidential. It does not assert that curvature has been observed, measured, or optimized in any empirical system. It asserts only that, given the formal exclusions already in place, any account of comprehension that admits invariant re-entry would be internally inconsistent with CIITR’s own negative diagnostics. Curvature is not introduced as a hypothesis about system behavior but as a boundary condition on what may coherently count as epistemic re-entry at all.

In this sense, the curvature condition is not an additional claim layered onto CIITR but the minimal closure of its ontological commitments. It ensures that R<sub>g</sub> cannot be satisfied by persistence alone, that recurrence cannot masquerade as revision, and that structural comprehension remains defined by transformation rather than survival. The corroboration resides entirely in conceptual necessity. No empirical appeal is required, and none is implied.
