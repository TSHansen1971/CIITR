# The Curvature Condition: Why Re-entry Must Change the System That Produces It

## Structural Corroboration Without Empirical Claim

The curvature condition constitutes the positive ontological complement to CIITR’s negative diagnostic axis. While ASEC, MIP, and epistemic forgery specify what R<sub>g</sub> is not, the curvature condition specifies what must minimally be the case for R<sub>g</sub> to be non-zero in principle. This specification is structurally corroborated without recourse to empirical observation.

The condition asserts that rhythmic epistemic re-entry is epistemic only if the act of returning alters the representational manifold that performs the return. This requirement follows directly from the definition of re-entry as a constitutive operation rather than a transport mechanism. If the system that returns is identical, in representational structure, to the system that initiated the return, then no epistemic transformation has occurred. The operation reduces to retrieval.

Structural corroboration here consists in demonstrating that without curvature, the concept of rhythmic reach collapses into temporal repetition. A flat representational topology can sustain persistence and oscillation, but it cannot generate epistemic differentiation through return. In such a topology, recurrence reproduces prior structure rather than reconfiguring it. R<sub>g</sub> therefore remains null regardless of temporal depth or storage fidelity.

The curvature condition introduces an asymmetry that is not empirical but logical. Retrieval operates on stored encodings while leaving the epistemic boundary intact. Re-entry, by contrast, modifies the boundary conditions of interpretation themselves. If no such modification occurs, the distinction between re-entry and recall dissolves, and with it the possibility of structural comprehension.

This corroboration does not claim that curvature has been detected, measured, or quantified in any given system. It specifies only that curvature is a *necessary structural criterion* for R<sub>g</sub>. Systems that fail to meet this criterion are excluded a priori from the domain of comprehension, not by observation but by definition.

In this sense, the curvature condition functions as an ontological gate rather than an empirical hypothesis. It constrains admissible interpretations of recurrence, continuity, and memory before any empirical evaluation is attempted. The absence of empirical claim is deliberate. It ensures that subsequent analyses cannot mistake repetition for learning or persistence for understanding. The corroboration lies in definitional closure: once re-entry is defined as structurally transformative, curvature is not optional but constitutive.

## The Curvature Condition: Why Re-entry Must Change the System That Produces It

The curvature condition admits corroboration strictly through ontological necessity. It does not rely on observed learning, adaptation, or measured transformation. Its validation lies in the internal coherence of CIITR’s definition of re-entry as a constitutive, not mnemonic, operation.

CIITR defines rhythmic epistemic re-entry as an operation that contributes positively to R<sub>g</sub> only insofar as it alters the representational manifold that performs the return. If the act of returning leaves the system structurally unchanged, then no epistemic transformation has occurred. The operation reduces to retrieval, and R<sub>g</sub> remains null. This conclusion is definitional, not empirical.

Structural corroboration here consists in demonstrating that without curvature, the concept of re-entry collapses into temporal repetition. A system capable of persistence and recurrence but incapable of structural inflection behaves as a flat representational topology. In such a topology, information may circulate, but circulation alone does not generate epistemic differentiation. Rhythm without curvature yields oscillation, not comprehension.

The necessity of curvature follows directly from the role assigned to R<sub>g</sub>. Rhythmic reach is not a count of cycles, nor a measure of duration. It denotes the capacity of a system to encounter its own prior states under altered epistemic conditions. If the system that returns is identical to the system that initiated the return, then the encounter produces no new structural constraint. In that case, the re-entry condition is not satisfied, regardless of temporal depth or representational fidelity.

This corroboration introduces no empirical claim about whether curvature occurs in biological or artificial systems. It specifies only that curvature is a *necessary condition* for R<sub>g</sub> to be non-zero in principle. Systems lacking this property are excluded a priori from the domain of structural comprehension. The exclusion is logical, not observational.

Structural corroboration without empirical claim thus performs an ontological closure function. It prevents the misclassification of continuity, memory, or recurrence as epistemic activity. The curvature condition is not a hypothesis awaiting confirmation but a criterion that determines what can count as re-entry at all. Once re-entry is defined as structurally transformative, curvature is not an added feature but a constitutive requirement.
