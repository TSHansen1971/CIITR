# CIITR: Cognitive Integration and Information Transfer Relation
**A Closed Theoretical Corpus on Structural Comprehension**

> "No rhythm, no understanding."

## Abstract
CIITR (Version 2.0) is a system-agnostic theoretical framework designed to quantify and diagnose **Structural Comprehension**. Unlike traditional models that measure intelligence through semantic fluency or task performance, CIITR focuses on the underlying relational architecture and temporal stability of information within a system.

## The Core Axiom: Substrate Independence
CIITR is fundamentally **substrate-independent**. The principles defined in this corpus apply to any information-processing entity, whether:
* **Biological** (Neural networks, organisms)
* **Social** (Organizations, systemic structures)
* **Technological** (Computational architectures, synthetic intelligence)

The framework treats the substrate as a diagnostic instrument, focusing solely on the integration ($\Phi_i$) and rhythmic reach ($R^g$) of the information it carries.

## The Mathematical Framework
At the heart of the CIITR ontology lies the formal metric for Structural Comprehension ($C_s$):

$$C_s = \Phi_i \times R^g$$

* **$\Phi_i$ (Relational Integration):** The spatial/structural binding of informational nodes.
* **$R^g$ (Rhythmic Reach):** The temporal stability and global broadcasting of integrated information.

## Repository Structure
This repository represents the formal ontology of the CIITR corpus, divided into four core modules:

* [**/axioms**](./axioms): The fundamental laws, manifesto, and normative statements.
* [**/formulas**](./formulas): Technical definitions of the quantitative metrics.
* [**/ontology**](./ontology): Precise definitions of the relational entities and terms.
* [**/diagnostics**](./diagnostics): Protocols for validation and drift control within a CIITR-installation.

## Theoretical Closure
As of December 2025, the CIITR framework is a **closed theoretical corpus**. Subsequent applications—such as METAINT, Vardespeil, and R.E.S.—constitute derivative architectures or applied extensions of this core ontology.
