# Structural Comprehension ($C_s$)

The fundamental metric of the CIITR framework defines structural comprehension as the product of spatial integration and temporal reach.

### The Equation
$$C_s = \Phi_i \times R^g$$

### Components
* **$C_s$ (Structural Comprehension):** The total quantitative value of a system's ability to maintain a coherent internal model of information.
* **$\Phi_i$ (Relational Integration):** The degree of interconnectedness between informational nodes within the corpus.
* **$R^g$ (Rhythmic Reach):** The temporal stability and "broadcast" range of the integrated information across the system's processing cycles.

### The Multiplicative Nature
Because this is a multiplicative relationship, if either $\Phi_i$ (integration) or $R^g$ (rhythm) approaches zero, $C_s$ collapses. Comprehension requires both a solid structure and a stable temporal pulse.
