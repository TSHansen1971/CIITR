## Purpose of this Repository

This repository functions as the **public canonical entry point** to the CIITR theory.

It is not a manuscript archive and not a working draft environment.  
Instead, it exposes the stable and citable components of the theory while separating them from private editorial material and ongoing development.

The repository therefore serves three parallel roles:

1. A reference specification
2. A formal ontology boundary
3. A publication index for associated theoretical works

The intention is that external readers, researchers, and technical evaluators can understand what CIITR *claims*, *defines*, and *permits to be inferred* without needing access to internal working material.

## Core Claim (Non-Interpretive Statement)

CIITR defines structural comprehension as a constrained epistemic condition emerging only when relational integration and temporal re-entry co-exist.

\[
C_s = \Phi_i \times R_g
\]

Where:

- **Cₛ**: structural comprehension  
- **Φᵢ**: integrated relational information (coherence across relations)  
- **Rᵍ**: rhythmic epistemic re-entry (temporal propagation and recursive consistency)

The equation is definitional, not empirical and not metaphorical.  
It specifies the boundary condition under which a system may be said to instantiate understanding rather than produce coherent outputs.

## Current Public Contents

At present the repository exposes the **CIITR Kernel**, also called the *Core Specification*.

This is the minimal formal body required to state the theory unambiguously.
